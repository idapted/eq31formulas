This is a sample mobile(iPhone/Android) app based on Titanium from idapted.com. We are preparing for the final release of this application.

We are experimenting the Titanium Mobile framework, it's amazing and very easy to use. Now our expert(Seven) is implementing the voice(VoIP) module for Titanium(http://www.appcelerator.com). At the same time we are working on another Mobile Project named mLearning.

Fork the app if you are interested in it.
